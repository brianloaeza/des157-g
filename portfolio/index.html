      <section class="about">
         <p>  My name is Brian Loaeza Lorenzo, a student from University of California, Davis with a June 2019 graduation date.
            My degree is in Design, with an emphasis in Graphic and Web design. I have profeciencies in Adobe Illustrator, PhotoShop, After Effects, InDesign,
            and I am well-versed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Processing (java based language).
         </p>
         <p>My interest in design all started when I was able to draw. I could never stop illustrating pictures and coloring a wide array of shapes
            and colors. For a long time it seemed as if I couldn't put my passion for drawing and visual creativity into an actual career. All I knew of the application
            of the arts were of artists selling portraits at some seaside pier, along with deceased famous people from an age when traditional
            art was more viable. It was only in community college that I realized that advertisments, websites, and logos were the modern application of the
            arts. I have been a designer since.
         </p>
         <p>I really enjoy the art of story telling, and try to use my mediums (websites, posters, drawings) to engage viewers
            with a message. It is what makes graphic and website design rewarding; you go in with a concept in mind and then do your best to deliver
            it. I try to focus on form and color first, as I believe it is what draws people in and leaves the biggest impact. In my spare time I can be found illustrating fashion or concepts for future comic book projects. It is a personal dream of mine to complete
            a comic book project that has been stewing in my mind for almost a decade, once I finalize its artistic direction.
         </p>

        <h2>DES 16: Adobe Illustrator</h2>
        <p>In this project it was required that we select a famous/widely used font and research its history in order to make a poster. The poster was to reflect our research, as well as
          the its intended use. I designed the poster to feel reminiscent of a cinematic film intro, with bold large words for the title and small credit lines running in the background. This
          is becuase the font is frequently used in film intros and credit scenes. Friz-Quadrata is here to steal the show, so I made sure it was the main focus of the poster.

        <p>In this project it was required to take pictures of items we thought would fit under the punk aesthetic, scan them in, and then put the elements together to make a poster for an
          incoming concert. After taking the pictures, we were to use the object to make a physical poster which served as a rough draft. After we were to use photoshop to isolate the objects we
          took photos of, and then using the concert info to make a graphic.

        <h2>DES 16: Adobe Illustrator, PhotoShop</h2>
        <p>In this project we had to select a famous convention and design a poster for the event. I chose San-Diego comic-con, since I have a love for comics and the art used to express
           the plot and themes. To advertise the event, I used one of the most well known heroes in comic-book history and reknown comic artists. I specifically chose a female comic artist
            becuase they do not recieve as wide-spread recognition and credit in the industry.

        <h2>DES 149: Adobe Illustrator</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this assignment was to research anything of our choice (prefferably an existing product company) and create an information graphic on a specific aspect of it.
          Natflix and the decline of cable is what initially came into mind, which then begged the question as to what medium it is consumed the most. Surely with it being mobile, it would see
          higher use using mobile technologies. However, that proved untrue, and I used the principals of information design to ensure that the information was easily understood.

        <h2>Intro to Computer Graphics: Adobe Photoshop</h2>
        <p>This assignment asked us to create a tryptich which represents ourselves, be it in a deep symbolic aspect or simply area of our interests. I elected to make the tryptich symbolic
          of who I am, my struggles, and aspirations. Most of my life I have felt caged, limited by my own sorrow and depression. However, I never saw myself as a being limited to my circumstances and
          condition. Rather, I had an innate optismism and creativity that allowed me to envision hope where I felt none - to see myself as powerfulr though I felt weak. The tryptich was to reflect these feelings,
          as well as illustrate my journey of self improvement as I live my life.

        <p>The final project for my information design class entailed designing a game that teaches the Design principals we learned, while simultaneously making it fun and relevent
          to campus. Given we only had 2 weeks to complete the assignment, it was rather ambitious to produce a game board, cards, icons, and complex rule set by myself. But, I succeeded
          in realizing my vision (barring three dimensional tokens) and frankly I am very proud of it.

        <h2>DES 157: HTML,CSS,JavaScript, BodyMovin Library Extension</h2>
        <p>For my interactive media ii class we had to do research on a topic regarding creativity or immigration. I chose immigration as my topic becuase I come from an immigrant background,
          and though I myself am not an immigrant my parents, however, are. Watching their struggles with the language and naturalizing themselves brought into question how accesible the
          information for naturalization really is. In my research and development, it became clear that the language used by the government to inform about the naturalization process was
          to complex and lengthy for someone with English as their second language. The robustness of the articles can be intimidating, and looking for help from proffessionals can induce
          fear in immigrants of being deported. My aim was to simplify it, and make an online virtual Lawyer who explains the process in a natural, simple, and
          inviting way from a safe space. While the project is incomplete for the time being, as we were only asked to produce a prototype, I aim to finish the project in the future. To see
          more of my process regarding this topic, you may click the following <a href = "https://brianloaeza.github.io/des157-g/">link</a>.
