        <h2>Maria Cordova (not a real person)</h2>
        <p> She was brought to the USA by her parents when she was 13 in the year 2008 due to the economic instabilities
          of Costa Rica. Though she understands english, her fluency and vocabulary is still rough around the edges, her parents facing even more difficulty
          as they migrated when they were much older. She has a highschool diploma, but couldn't attend college becuase she needed to help her family
          with extra income for her 2 brothers.
